    "\n",
    "A time-series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties such as mean, variance remain constant over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it important? Because most time-series models work on the assumption that **the time-series is stationary**. For general time-series datasets, if it shows a particular behaviour over time, there is a very high probability that it will follow a similar behaviour in the future. Also, the theories related to stationary series are more mature and easier to implement as compared to non-stationary series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although stationarity is defined using very strict criteria, for practical purposes we can assume the series to be stationary if it has following constant statistical properties over time:\n",
    "\n",
    "> * **The mean of the series should not be a function of time rather should be a constant. The image below has the left hand graph satisfying the condition whereas the graph in red has a time dependent mean.**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Mean_nonstationary.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> * **The variance of the series should not a be a function of time. This property is known as homoscedasticity. Following graph depicts what is and what is not a stationary series. (Notice the varying spread of distribution in the right hand graph)**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Var_nonstationary.png)\n",
    "> * **The covariance of the i th term and the (i + m) th term should not be a function of time. In the following graph, you will notice the spread becomes closer as the time increases. Hence, the covariance is not constant with time for the ‘red series’ below.**\n",

We used rolling statistics, with rolling mean and rolling standrad deviation to check for trends and seasonal elements in a time-series. We also learnt how to use Dickey Fuller test to run statistical test on a time-series and check for its staionarity with a significance level. Following labs will further explore stationarity and how to ensure it. "
